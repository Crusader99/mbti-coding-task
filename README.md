# Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation: Coding Task


## Selected Technology Stack:

- Programming Language: **Kotlin** for better robustness against NullPointerExceptions and more readable code.
- Build Tool: **Gradle** with Kotlin DSL for consistent usage of Kotlin, even in build scripts.
- Tests:
    - **JUnit 5** to identify errors in the merge algorithm through automated test units.
    - PowerAsserts: For clearer error messages.
- Continuous Integration (CI):
    - GitHub Actions to automatically execute all test units after every commit.
    - Earthly for reproducible execution, independent of GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.
